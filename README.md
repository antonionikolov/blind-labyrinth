Blind Labyrinth
===============
The point of the game, like every labyrinth game, is to get from the start
to the final. The difference is - in that game you don't see anything exept
the area next to the object you control, which will make it more dificult and
test your photographic memory.

Functionality
-------------
It is a single player game with authomatic generation of the labyrinth. The
player determines what size will be the labyrinth. The project supports console
user interface and graphical user interface.
